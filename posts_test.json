Buy a water filtration system (I prefer the [Platypus brand gravity filter](https://www.amazon.com/Platypus-GravityWorks-Backpacking-Compatible-Hydration/dp/B00A9A2HKM/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1533692409&sr=8-3&keywords=platypus+gravity+filter)) and at least a couple spare filters. Buy at least 2 weeks of canned food that you won't touch for at least a week after the event (unless you plan to be moving). Dry beans and rice are better for your calorie/weight ratio. Buy a shotgun or pistol with a decent amount of ammo (I'm thinking 500 rounds for a pistol or at least 100 shotgun shells) and get familiar with using it safely. Cash, if cash isn't working, gold and silver ain't either. Also, a hand crank or solar battery charger, [which can be found for around $20](https://www.amazon.com/Upgrade-Esky-Emergency-Powered-Flashlight/dp/B018I4BPNU) combined with a flashlight and radio. Bam!, you're now better prepped than 95+% of the population. Some other additional items: flashlights, rope, tarp, Bic lighters, padlocks & chains (heavy so wouldn't be great for travel), enough gas to drive to a location you believe would be safe, hiking backpack. [US Air Force Survival Manual](https://www.amazon.com/United-States-Search-Survival-Training/dp/1586637223) for reading I recognize guns are a touchy subject with many people here, but in this day and age, I would encourage you to look at the world around us and maybe see that we could be in a more precarious position in our society than we would like. I would hope that the US would never come to a point in which gear like this might be necessary, but it is better to build dikes than just to pray for sunshine. Anyway, if guns truly aren't your thing, or you're in Europe or somewhere they are not as common as the US, just don't get one.",

Luckily, we used to have this awesome President named Barack Hussein Obama, and he was a true patriot, and an intelligent, thoughtful, and caring man who wanted the best for all of his nations' citizens. So, he had the foresight to set up a special task force within the ranks of federal law enforcement specifically focused on the emerging and immediate threat posed by white nationalistic domestic terrorism. Truly, it was a wise and sound decision for the future of the nation and all of her peoples. Which is why, Donald Trump made one of his first actions after conspiring with the Russians to steal the Presidency of the United States of America, to immediately dissolve the aforementioned federal task force whose purpose had been to protect us all from the deranged and violent white nationalists that are currently festering within the dark & unwashed hollows of our fair land.

When the Nazis are met with counter-protesters, who do the cops beat down and arrest more: the Nazis or the not Nazis? Again, the white racists have the established political power and the guns and badges to back it up and use it to protect the numerous white racists.
