Here are some facts for all of you since nobody has brought it up as far as I've seen. First off this title is clickbaity as fuck. \"Sharia-compliant\" implies that the whole of Europe has fallen under Muslim rule of law. This is not that. Second, Austria, where this whole situation started, has laws against blasphemy: [\"Whoever publicly disparages or ridicules a person or thing that is the object of worship of a domestically existing church or religious society, or a doctrine, a lawful practice, or a lawful institution of such a church or religious society, under whose behavior is likely to cause legitimate annoyance shall be punished with imprisonment of up to six months or a fine of up to 360 daily rates.\"](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Dokumentnummer=NOR12029737) Which means that this ruling is consistent with Austrian law. And lastly, I'm more than open to discussion about pretty much anything, but holy shit do a lot of people in this thread not know how to form coherent arguments past \"I'm right, their wrong.\" Learn some philosophy or something, because the type of stuff I've seen in this thread is exactly the reason so many people outside of the conservative sphere look down upon conservatives. I want legitimate, positive discourse between everyone, I want a country where we can have discussion and debate, and you can't do that if the only ammunition you have is \"I'm right, deal with it,\" or \"My religion says so.\"",

You have to look at cultures in the context of the period of history that they exist. The Austrian Courts even agreed: from the article \"It noted that the Austrian courts had held that ES was making value judgments partly based on untrue facts and without regard to the historical context.\" If she had any real argument I doubt that this would be an issue, but she said (found from another article) \"Muhammad had a nine-year-old wife, if that's not pedophilia, what is it?\" By that logic a majority of ancient Greeks and Romans were pedophiles. Except that they weren't, not in the way that we define the word today.

So how do you define morals? I'm not disagreeing that sexually abusing children is wrong, but looking at societies in context is not apologia. So first lets check out the definition of pedophilia: sexual feelings directed toward children. So, unless we can back up with evidence that Muhammad was seeking out children to have sexual relationships with then he was not a pedophile. Additionally, in [Roman](https://books.google.com/books?id=WVEjYPaeuTgC&pg=PA53v=onepage&q&f=false), [Jewish](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10861-minorityanchor3), and [English](http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230) traditions from as recent as 1200 A.D. Another important thing that is attached to all of these is when a woman goes through her first menstruation which is mentioned by Aisha in the Sahih Bukhari. I think the most important thing to remember is that Islam is a religion just like Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, etc. Badness comes from the people that interpret and practice said religion. Indonesia and India both have massive Muslim populations, being the 1st and 3rd most Islamic countries by population.

    "body": "that this WAS NOT \"all about validating Islam in order to pacify the anger and disaffection of European Muslims\"....so unless you actually have an argument to provide along with this statement I'm going to leave it at this. There are all kinds of anecdotal evidence all over Europe for anyone who is not blind....from the banishing of Robert Spencer from England to the harassment and persecution of people speaking out against Islamic intolerance, people like Hirsi Ali (forced into exile), Bridgette Bardot (prosecution and fines), Marie Le Pen (forced to see a psychiatrist for publicizing the atrocities of ISIS), Geert Wilders (living on an army base because he's been so vilified in the press that he doesn't want to share the same fate as Pim Fortuyun)....to the turning of a blind eye to the rape of thousands of British children over decades because no one wanted to be accused of racism. Yes indeed, I'd say Europe has a very REAL problem in trying to pacify its Muslim population. >I'm not disagreeing that sexually abusing children is wrong, but looking at societies in context is not apologia. So first lets check out the definition of pedophilia: sexual feelings directed toward children. So, unless we can back up with evidence that Muhammad was seeking out children to have sexual relationships with then he was not a pedophile. You came in here on your high horse.....self-righteously judging everyone for their indignation over this story....and here you show us the extent of your own pathetic ignorance, corrupted by your moral relativism. Let me try to enlighten you....the fact that Muhammad had sex with a little girl meant he was attracted to little girls. It is ELEMENTARY LOGIC....the kind that escapes moral relativists like yourself. >I think the most important thing to remember is that Islam is a religion just like Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, etc. Believe it or not, there are actual theological differences between the varying faiths. There are actual ethical differences between Buddhism and Islam...between the values promulgated by Muhammad in the Hadith and Sirat Rasul...and those promulgated by Jesus in the Gospel. This might come as an absolute shock to a relativist like yourself, but believe it or not, all religions don't teach the same things. >Badness comes from the people that interpret and practice said religion. Indeed. But there are DEGREES of behavior....and theological particulars actually have an influence on such behavior. Christians have killed in the name of Christ in CONTRAVENTION to his teachings. Muslims kill in the name of Allah in COMPLIANCE to the teachings of Muhammad. >Indonesia and India both have massive Muslim populations, being the 1st and 3rd most Islamic countries by population. Who doesn't know that? So what. Do you happen to know that so-called \"moderate\" Indonesia is beset with Islamic extremism? That thousands of non-Muslims have been slaughtered there in the last 20 years by Muslim extremists? That dozens of churches have been burned over the same period? That over 90% of Muslim women in Indonesia have had their genitals mutilated? That over 60 Muslim organizations in Indonesia recently pledged allegiance to ISIS? Not bad for a \"moderate\" Muslim country, eh? Better find a new example....(good luck with that). As for India, it too has extensive problems with Islamic extremism. But the worst is fortunately kept in check by the NON-Muslim government there. Not so in neighboring Pakistan, where extremism rampant and Sharia is law. ",

Part of it was your monstrous contention that the rape of a child is not the rape of a child if it is culturally normative. And part of it was the core of your argument, that since the blasphemy laws are on the books in Austria, the persecution of Elisabeth Sabbaditch-Wolf for daring to speak the truth about Muhammad was somehow NOT a human-rights violation.

I felt like I couldn't take my hand off my wallet in case they tried to pick pocket me. Walking around with your head on a swivel with your young wife in a country you don't know the language in is extremely stressful. We were planning on going to the Louvre after the Eiffel tower but we just went back to the hotel when we read that the Louvre is more of a hot spot for crime then the Eiffel tower. We are leaving Paris tomorrow and we will never be back. I felt good in London though. People were friendly, everything was nice and clean and there was no one trying to scam you.

So, if we are to believe Islam's own scripture, Wolf's statement was objectively true. And what was the Austrian Judge's reasoning for convicting her? He insisted Muhammad could NOT have been a pedophile because he continued to have sex with Aisha AFTER she had become an adult! I kid you not folks! This is justice European style! https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/2702/sabaditsch-wolff-appeal >The judge ruled that Sabaditsch-Wolff committed a crime by stating in her seminars about Islam that the Islamic prophet Mohammed was a pedophile (Sabaditsch-Wolff's actual words were \"Mohammed had a thing for little girls.\") >The judge rationalized that Mohammed's sexual contact with nine-year-old Aisha could not be considered pedophilia because Mohammed continued his marriage to Aisha until his death.

Austria (application no. 38450/12) the European Court of Human Rights held, unanimously, that there had been: no violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The case concerned the applicant’s conviction for disparaging religious doctrines; she had made statements suggesting that Muhammad had had paedophilic tendencies. The Court found in particular that the domestic courts comprehensively assessed the wider context of the applicant’s statements and carefully balanced her right to freedom of expression with the right of others to have their religious feelings protected, and served the legitimate aim of preserving religious peace in Austria. It held that by considering the impugned statements as going beyond the permissible limits of an objective debate, and by classifying them as an abusive attack on the Prophet of Islam which could stir up prejudice and threaten religious peace, the domestic courts put forward relevant and sufficient reasons. Principal facts The applicant, E.S., is an Austrian national who was born in 1971 and lives in Vienna (Austria). In October and November 2009, Mrs S. held two seminars entitled “Basic Information on Islam”, in which she discussed the marriage between the Prophet Muhammad and a six-year old girl, Aisha, which allegedly was consummated when she was nine. Inter alia, the applicant stated that Muhammad “liked to do it with children” and “... A 56-year-old and a six-year-old? ... What do we call it, if it is not paedophilia?”. On 15 February 2011 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court found that these statements implied that Muhammad had had paedophilic tendencies, and convicted Mrs S. for disparaging religious doctrines. She was ordered to pay a fine of 480 euros and the costs of the proceedings. Mrs S. appealed but the Vienna Court of Appeal upheld the decision in December 2011, confirming in essence the lower court’s findings. A request for the renewal of the proceedings was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 11 December 2013. Complaints, procedure and composition of the Court Relying on Article 10 (freedom of expression), Mrs S. complained that the domestic courts failed to address the substance of the impugned statements in the light of her right to freedom of expression. If they had done so, they would not have qualified them as mere value judgments but as value judgments based on facts. Furthermore, her criticism of Islam occurred in the framework of an objective and lively discussion which contributed to a public debate, and had not been aimed at Under Articles 43 and 44 of the Convention, this Chamber judgment is not final. During the three-month period following its delivery, any party may request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber of the Court. If such a request is made, a panel of five judges considers whether the case deserves further examination. In that event, the Grand Chamber will hear the case and deliver a final judgment. If the referral request is refused, the Chamber judgment will become final on that day. Once a judgment becomes final, it is transmitted to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe for supervision of its execution. Further information about the execution process can be found here: www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/execution. 2 defaming the Prophet of Islam. Lastly, Mrs S. submitted that religious groups had to tolerate even severe criticism. The application was lodged with the European Court of Human Rights on 6 June 2012. Judgment was given by a Chamber of seven judges, composed as follows: Angelika Nußberger (Germany), President, André Potocki (France), Síofra O’Leary (Ireland), Mārtiņš Mits (Latvia), Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer (Austria), Lәtif Hüseynov (Azerbaijan), Lado Chanturia (Georgia), and also Claudia Westerdiek, Section Registrar. Decision of the Court Article 10 The Court noted that those who choose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion under Article 9 of the Convention could not expect to be exempt from criticism. They must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs. Only where expressions under Article 10 went beyond the limits of a critical denial, and certainly where they were likely to incite religious intolerance, might a State legitimately consider them to be incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion and take proportionate restrictive measures. The Court observed also that the subject matter of the instant case was of a particularly sensitive nature, and that the (potential) effects of the impugned statements, to a certain degree, depended on the situation in the respective country where the statements were made, at the time and in the context they were made. Accordingly, it considered that the domestic authorities had a wide margin of appreciation in the instant case, as they were in a better position to evaluate which statements were likely to disturb the religious peace in their country. The Court reiterated that it has distinguished in its case-law between statements of fact and value judgments. It emphasised that the truth of value judgments was not susceptible to proof. However, a value judgment without any factual basis to support it might be excessive. The Court noted that the domestic courts comprehensively explained why they considered that the applicant’s statements had been capable of arousing justified indignation; specifically, they had not been made in an objective manner contributing to a debate of public interest (e.g. on child marriage), but could only be understood as having been aimed at demonstrating that Muhammad was not worthy of worship. It agreed with the domestic courts that Mrs S. must have been aware that her statements were partly based on untrue facts and apt to arouse indignation in others. The national courts found that Mrs S. had subjectively labelled Muhammad with paedophilia as his general sexual preference, and that she failed to neutrally inform her audience of the historical background, which consequently did not allow for a serious debate on that issue. Hence, the Court saw no reason to depart from the domestic courts’ qualification of the impugned statements as value judgments which they had based on a detailed analysis of the statements made. The Court found in conclusion that in the instant case the domestic courts carefully balanced the applicant’s right to freedom of expression with the rights of others to have their religious feelings protected, and to have religious peace preserved in Austrian society. 3 The Court held further that even in a lively discussion it was not compatible with Article 10 of the Convention to pack incriminating statements into the wrapping of an otherwise acceptable expression of opinion and claim that this rendered passable those statements exceeding the permissible limits of freedom of expression. Lastly, since Mrs S. was ordered to pay a moderate fine and that fine was on the lower end of the statutory range of punishment, the criminal sanction could not to be considered as disproportionate. Under these circumstances, and given the fact that Mrs S. made several incriminating statements, the Court considered that the Austrian courts did not overstep their wide margin of appreciation in the instant case when convicting Mrs S. of disparaging religious doctrines. Overall, there had been no violation of Article 10. The judgment is available only in English. This press release is a document produced by the Registry. It does not bind the Court.

It's a common misconception and lots of people think the crusades were just Christians killing tons of people if they didn't convert to Christianity or some other weird reason for lots of murdering. The real reason is that the crusades were a direct military response to the Byzantine empire getting attacked. The Byzantines were Christian. They were attacked by Seljuk Turks who were Muslim. The Byzantine emperor asked the Christians in Europe to aid and they responded. So yeah it was a holy war between Christians and Muslims. Not just Christians running around killing people for not being Christian. I know /u/HardCounter did not say any of this, but I got an implied feeling and felt the need to comment in case anyone else reading was interested in knowing why the crusades actually happened.",

I do not think Muslims have any more evil in the hearts than anyone else. I’ve known quite a few. Generally speaking, I think they just want to be happy and care for their families and they have no desire to hurt anyone. I think both the Bible and Koran contain immense wisdom. Unfortunately, I believe they both contain flaws that cannot be reconciled with Western society. The problem is that many Muslims believe the Koran is the direct word of God and cannot be altered or edited, and that it’s words are objectively true. Islam also provides a legal system that also cannot be changed. Most intelligent Christians fully acknowledge that the Bible has been corrupted by mankind. Or they believe the Bible is simply figurative and symbolic, not meant to be taken literally. For example, both the Bible and the Koran endorses stoning women to death under certain circumstances. People still practice stoning under Islam but not Judaism or Christianity. And people still kill other people for insulting the Prophet, but not Jesus. I realize the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and do not do this but stay with me. Here is where I see the crucial difference in the religions: Muhammad demanded you “submit to God”. The problem is that this provides a model for these radical groups to follow. Following the violent example of the Prophet, these violent radicals can justify murder in the name of Islam. There is a Holy War and they want to defeat the enemy. The Koran does not demand compulsion, but some translations endorse killing non-believers, hastening their understanding of Allah. This is why your earthly life is insignificant to Allah. By saying “choose God”, Jesus is giving you the choice to turn away and reject God, to actively join with the forces of evil and work against God’s will. Jesus doesn’t promise the salvation of mankind, he offers it as a gift that we can still reject. There is a holy war, but it is within our hearts. Jesus was peaceful and sacrificed himself, rather than those who disagreed with him. This is why Christian missionaries travel the world and sacrifice their labor and resources to help and teach the less fortunate. They believe your earthly life is your chance to follow Jesus and help others, and that each life is divine and must be saved by willfully following the Jesus. What do you believe to be the purpose of humanity according to Islam? ",

They complain to the ECHR, and ECHR said basically \"We don't think this is a clear enough case to justify us interfering with Austrian laws\". So it isn't like they said that blasphemy laws must be in force all over Europe. Rather, they said that this particular case isn't enough to make them interfere with Austria's sovereignty. I think we can all agree that the court is still wrong, but that this is a far less outrageous decision than the title implies. The more important question is why on earth does Austria have blasphemy laws? They have a right-wing government that could easily overturn them, so I guess most people haven't realized that the law even exists.",
